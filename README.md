## Voice Assistant

This Python script implements a simple virtual assistant using speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis. The assistant can recognize voice commands, such as asking for the current time or date, greeting the user based on the time of day, opening YouTube in a web browser, and responding to expressions of gratitude and farewells.

## Dependencies:

# speech_recognition for speech recognition functionality.
# pyttsx3 for text-to-speech synthesis.
# webbrowser for opening URLs in the default web browser.
Usage:

Run the script and interact with the assistant by speaking voice commands.
Feel free to extend and customize the functionality to suit your needs!
